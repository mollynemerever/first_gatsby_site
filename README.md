# My First Gatsby Site!

#### Molly Nemerever

### Project Objectives:
Welcome to my first project using Gatsby.js. I'm teaching myself how to utilize Gatsby.js through YouTube tutorials and documentation. I'll also be using Sass in this project for my very first time :) 

This site will be a portfolio for my partner, David Lee, showcasing his work as a Data Scientist. This is project is currently in-progress and should be completed by mid-August. Documentation/Readme will be updated with deployment link. 

Stay tuned!
